/**
*@class Frame This class defines a frame in the yz plane, on which the body surface is built. 
 * This is similar to the way a real life body is designed and built.
 * The Frame's points may be used indiferently by a spline-type or a flat-panel-type body.
 * The Frmae's points are defined from bottom to top, i.e. for crescending z values, and for the body's left (port) side. 
  * The x-value of the control points is unused, the frame's position is defined by the variable m_Position.
