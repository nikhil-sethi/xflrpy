/**
*@class Panel
*@brief    This class defines the quad panel object used both in VLM and in 3d-panel analysis

*    The class provides member variables which define the geometric properties of the panel, and functions used in the 3D analysis.
*
*    The name of the variables follows closely the naming used in the document NASA Contractor report 4023 "Program VSAERO Theory Document".
    Refer to this document for detailed explanations on the description of the panel and the meaning of the variables.
    The nodes are defined in a separate global array. The index of the nodes at the four corners are stored as
    member variables of this panel.
*
*    For VLM calculations, the position and length vector of the bound vortex at the panel's quarter-chord are
    stored as member variables.
