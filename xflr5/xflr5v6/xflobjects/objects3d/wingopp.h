/**
*@brief
*    This class implements the operating point object which stores the data of plane analysis
*
    In the case of an analysis of an independant wing, the instance of this WingOpp class is
    uniquely associated to an instance of a WPolar, which is itself uniquely associated to the Wing object.
    Alternatively, the WingOpp may be a member variable of a PlaneOpp object.
    The data is stored in International Standard Units, i.e. meters, seconds, kg, and Newtons.
    Angular data is stored in degrees.
