/**
*@class Surface
*@brief
 * The class which defines the surface object on which the panels are constructed for the VLM and 3d-panel calculations.
 * The mesh panels are not constructed using the Wing object, but on this proxy Surface object.
 *
 A surface extends from one left Foil to the next right Foil in the spanwise directions.

 * The Surface's geometry is defined by
 *    - its Leading edge  : m_LA, m_LB
 *    - its Trailing edge : m_TA, m_TB
 *    - its left and right twist
 *    - its left and right Foil objects
 *    - its Normal vector
 *    - its left and right normal vectors NormalA and NormalB are
 *      the average of the normals of the two continuous surfaces ; used to define junction between panels
 *
 * The points and other geometric data may be requested by calling methods on any of the top, middle, or bottom surfaces.

 Surfaces are constructed and indexed from left tip to right tip.

 For a half-wing, there will be one surface less than the number of foils defined by the user.


 The letter A refers to the Surface's left side, and B refers to the right side.
 The letter L refers to the Leading upstream side, T refers to the Trailing downstream side

 A surface is described by its geometric properties inherited from the wing's definition.
 Surfaces with a span length less than a minimum value are ignored.

 A surface may only supports trailing edge flaps.
 A surface may not be flat if different washout angles have been defined at the tips. However the deviation from
 the flat panel is assumed to be small, and corresponding approximations are made.

 The process of Surface construction starts by the creation of the array of master points at each end Foil.
 These points are defined i.a.w. the number of panels and the type of distribution specified by the user.
 The panel points are interpolated between the left and right Foil points.
 This implies that a wing is built with a fixed number of chordwise panels all along the span.
 The panels on the surface are added incrementally to the global array of panels used for the panel analysis.

 The panels are numbered from left tip to right tip in the span wise direction. Then in the chordwise direction:
        from T.E. to L.E in the case of VLM
        from lower surface TE, to leading edge, and to upper surface TE


 The data is stored in International Standard Units, i.e. meters, seconds, kg, and Newtons.
 Angular data is stored in degrees.
